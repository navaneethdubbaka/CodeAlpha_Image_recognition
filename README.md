# CodeAlpha_Image_recognition
 "Custom CNN model for image recognition trained on 8 classes. High accuracy with TensorFlow. Ready for deployment."
Project Title: Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

Description:
This repository contains code for an image recognition project implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to classify images into different categories using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images belonging to various classes.

Key Features:

Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning implementation.
Implements data preprocessing using ImageDataGenerator for efficient training.
Defines a CNN model architecture consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.
Trains the model on a training dataset and evaluates its performance on a separate testing dataset.
Saves the trained model for future use and deployment.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Organize your image dataset into appropriate directories for training and testing.
Update the paths to your training and testing datasets in the code.
Run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Optionally, fine-tune the model parameters or architecture for better performance.
Save the trained model for future inference or deployment.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains images categorized into different classes. It can be replaced with custom datasets according to specific requirements.

Note:
Feel free to contribute to the project by improving the model architecture, adding new features, or optimizing the code for better performance.
